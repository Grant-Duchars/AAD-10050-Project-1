        <h3>Videogames</h3>
        <p>
          I am an avid videogame player and is actually the reason I got into
          computer science in the first place. I pretty much play any and every
          type of game but it is mainly contained to the PC gaming sphere. Some
          of my favorites include Minecraft, Dark Souls, Dusk, Outer Wilds, etc.

        <h3>Board games</h3>
        <p>
          I addition to videogames, I also like boardgames. Getting together
          with a group of friends and playing games like Magic: The Gathering,
          Binding of Isaac: Four Souls, Twilight Imperium, etc. are some of the
          best times I've had.

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          Finally a more recent addition is cooking. This summer I decided I
          would try my hand at making a Tikka Masala recipe I found online and
          now I love cooking. Finding different recipes, going out and searching
          for the unique ingredients, prepping, and then actually cooking, I
          love it all, and in the end after the hard work is over, I have
          something tasty to eat.
